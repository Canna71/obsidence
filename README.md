This simple plugin copy the current note (or a selection if in edit mode) into the format suitable to be pasted into Confluence or Jira preserving the original semantic of the markdown (e.g. code blocks).

You can use either the ribbon button or the following commands:

`Copy whole note to Confluence/Jira`

`Copy selection to Confluence/Jira` (if in edit mode)

## Manually installing the plugin
